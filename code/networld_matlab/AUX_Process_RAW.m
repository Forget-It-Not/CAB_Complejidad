% AUX_Process_RAW:
%   Processing of the RAW output of a Networld simulation

% Input Data:
%   Networks: list with a position for each time point of the simulation,
%   such that each position contains a list of the network adyacency
%   matrices present in that time point

%   Networks_Unique: Set of networks (their adj matrix) that have been
%   previously identified (across all simulation that have used the global
%   metadata)

%   Networks_Measures: Measures of each network that has been identified
%   (across all simulations that have used the global metadata)

%   Networks_Key: Equivalence key between the index of a network in
%   Networks_Measures and its identifier (= index in Networks_Unique). See
%   pseudocode for more information.

% Output Data:
%   Networks_Time: Row for each (repeated) network that appeared in the 
%   simulation, where the columns correspond to: t, NRed (references 
%   Network_Unique) and NRep (=1)

%   Metadata: √çdem as input but updated with the new networks found
%   in the simulation 
%
